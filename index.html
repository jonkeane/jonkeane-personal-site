  <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
  <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="http://linguistics.uchicago.edu">Linguistics</a> at the <a href="http://uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>. I also work as a research assistant in the <a href="http://signlanguagelab.uchicago.edu">Sign Language Linguistics Lab</a> as well as the <a href="http://clml.uchicago.edu">Chicago Language Modeling Lab</a>. I have many research interests, particularly articulatory phonetics and phonology, morphology, and computational approaches to each. I am currently working on projects involving sign language phonetics and phonology.</p>

 <p>Since the fall of 2009 I've been working with a research group consisting of researchers specializing in linguistics, speech and language processing, and computer vision problems, with the goal of developing automated sign language recognition tools. This collaboration fostered my interest in the phonetics of fingerspelling. I hope to continue to develop models and tools that contribute both to our knowledge of phonetics generally, as well as inform automatic recognizers of fingerspelling.</p>

	<p>
          Since the fall of 2009 I've been working with a research group consisting of researchers specializing in linguistics, speech and language processing, and computer vision problems, with the goal of developing automated sign language recognition tools. This collaboration fostered my interest in the phonetics of fingerspelling. 
        </p>

	<p>Fingerspelling is used anywhere from 12 to 35
	percent of the time in <span style="font-variant:
	small-caps;">asl</span>, (<a class="cite"
	href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22How+the+alphabet+came+to+be+used+in+a+sign+language%22"
	title="C. Padden and D. Gunsauls. How the alphabet came to be used in a sign language. Sign Language Studies, 4:10–33, 2003.">Padden and Gunsauls, 2003</a>) and as such should not
	be set aside as extralinguistic. There has only been a small amount of information put together on the phonetics of fingerspelling. The only work on fingerspelling phonetics explicitly that I've found is (<a class="cite" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22The+phonetics+of+fingerspelling%22" title="S. Wilcox. The phonetics of fingerspelling. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1992.">Wilcox 1992</a>) as well as (<a class="cite" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Interarticulator+co-ordination+in+deaf+signers+with+parkinson’s+disease%22" title="M. Tyrone, J. Kegl, and H. Poizner. Interarticulator co-ordination in deaf signers with parkinson’s disease. Neuropsychologia, 37(11):1271–1283, 1999.">Tyrone et al. 1999</a>).</p>

  <p>My current work explores how fingerspelling production, with the ultimate goal of describing and modeling variation that exists in handshape, orientation, timing, &amp;c. We are working on developing a system for coding fingerspelling phonetically that is reliable and easy to implement.</p>

<blockquote class="abstract">
<p>At 13 seconds per annotation, we have developed a system for coding <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">asl</span> fingerspelling that is not only quick and easy, and (most importantly) reproducible with very high agreement. Our method breaks coding into discrete tasks, each of which ought to be more reproducible than traditional transcription-style coding. Although used with fingerspelling, similar styles of coding could be adapted for many other types of linguistic data. These data can be used to address questions about the timing of fingerspelling, and with further feature annotations, the phonetics of fingerspelling and handshape generally..</p>

<h5>Variation in segment duration in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">asl</span> fingerspelling</h5>
<p>Jonathan Keane (University of Chicago), Erin Dahlgren (University of Chicago), Jason Riggle (University of Chicago)</p>
<blockquote class="abstract">

<p>In the course of a larger project working on fingerspelling recognition we compiled a database with over 3 hours of native signers fingerspelling a variety of words. This data was coded, and a reliable measure of duration was developed. We quantitatively confirmed several assumptions about fingerspelling (eg there is individual variation, and signers fingerspell slower non-English compared to English words). We also found that when fingerspelling longer words there is some evidence that signers chunk segments together into groups of 3-5 letters, which suggests a memory constraint, articulatory processing effect, or even perceiver oriented facilitation.</p>

  <h2>Software</h2>
  
  <p>Some interesting, and hopefully helpful tools for others. Most of it is software in a very, very broad sense of the word.</p>
   
  <h3>Fingerspell LaTeX package</h3>
  
  <p>I've developed <a href="http://github.com/jonkeane/fingerspell">the Fingerspell LaTeX package</a> to make it easier to typeset examples of fingerspelling. It allows for fingerspelled words, as well as lists of individual letters with hyphens on either side. On top of dealing with setting smallcaps and adding hyphens, it also keeps words together, as well as protecting the hyphens around a letter near line breaks. See the readme at GitHub for more information.</p>
       
<h3><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">asl</span> fingerspelling chart</h3>

<img src="Asl_alphabet_gallaudet.jpg" alt="Chart of ASL fingerspelling" />

<p>After seeing many charts that were licensed and reproduced with permission I decided to recreate a fingerspelling chart and release it using a very liberal content license so researchers and educators that need this chart can use it (nearly) freely. The handshapes are based on the font from David Rakowski.</p>

<p>There a few problems with this chart. The biggest problem is that the orientation of many letters is altered to show the configuration of the fingers. In reality, all of the handshapes are made with the palming facing out, away from the signer with the exception of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-g-</span> (in, towards the signer), <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-h-</span> (in, towards the signer), <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-p-</span> (down), <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-q-</span> (down) and the end of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">-j-</span> (to the side)</p>

<h3>Better type for LaTeX</h3>

<p>In the pursuit of better typography for LaTeX I've found a couple of good walkthroughs, and a couple of invaluable tools. All of the following have been tested on TeX Live 2009, 2010, and 2011 on both OS X 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7. </p>

	
<h4>Minion Pro</h4>
<p>I've created <a href="http://github.com/jonkeane/MinionProforLaTeX">a bash script</a> that installs Minion Pro to a local tex live tree with very little user intervention.
</p>

<h4>otfinst.py</h4>
<p>
John Owens has developed <a href="http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/code/otfinst/">a great python tool</a> that installs many OpenType fonts. The only stumbling block I found besides some font incompatibilities was assigning (making up) <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/fontname/fontname.pdf">Berry names</a> to the fonts that I wanted to install, which have to be added to the script. I have made up names for the following that seem to follow most of the conventions. If anyone knows of more widespread names for these typefaces please <a href="mailto:jonkeane@uchicago.edu">let me know</a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>'Neutraface Text' : 'fne'</li>
  <li>'Neutraface Display' : 'fn3'</li>
  <li>'Gotham' : 'fg7'</li>
  <li>'Gotham Rounded' : 'fg8'</li>
</ul>
