"Is that failure a flaky test? â€” We can ignore that failure, it's a flake â€” Let me rerun these; that's a flake." everywhere that I've worked; every team I've worked with; I've heard these or similar.[^1] When I was earlier in my career this felt reassuring and calming. The test failed, but it's ok! It sometimes just does that, click re-run and move on. Simple! 

But it also left me unsatisfied: I couldn't ever stop that nagging voice in my head from asking "but why?". Ultimately after some sleepless nights and a number of deep dives into the specific so-called flaky tests, I've come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a flaky test.  

I can hear the shouts on the internet already: "No, no this test really does only fail sometimes. That's the definition of flaky!" and that is absolutely true, that is the definition of flaky. But a test that fails sometimes is not a test that we should rely on. A test that fails sometimes leads us to either reflexively re-run tests when we see a failure â€” or worse, become desensitized to seeing red in our testing and ignoring it. And in that way, a test that fails sometimes is worse than no test at all![^8]

### Ways tests go bad

So if there is no such thing as a flaky test â€” what is going on here? Why do people call tests flaky? Ultimately, I've found that so-called flaky tests are tests that have been poorly designed or implemented in some way. And the great thing about this framing is that it gives us something that we can do to improve when we stumble on a test that isn't helping us the way it should. I'll go over some of the common ways that tests can be poorly designed or implemented that make them go bad â€” but this list is not exhaustive. And which of these that apply to you will vary based on what you're building and testing.


#### Testing at the wrong level

Tests come in a bunch of different flavors: unit tests, integration tests, end to end tests, etc. the specific differences between those is outside the scope of this post[^4], but one source of so-called flakiness is from including many layers within tests. End to end tests are great because they test the entire flow through a system. But if your system spans across layers that involve boundaries (like network communication), the chances that something goes wrong in the middle that's not relevant to what your test is testing increases. The more layers you cross, the higher the probability something outside of your test will fail.

As with all things, balance is important: having a balance of unit tests that test a wide range of inputs to small functions balanced with end to end tests that test common flows will behave more reliably than a test suite that is reversed: Using end to end tests to cover a large selectionf of strange inputs and represent the spectrum of inputs while having limited unit tests. 

Another option when you're crossing service boundaries (like APIs or databases[^5]) is to use mocks in your tests. The beauty of mocks is that not only do you not need to deal with network connections, but you can also produce conditions or output that would otherwise not be possible from a current, running system. Remember that one funky circumstance when the backend produced garbled output and the front end didn't handle it gracefully? With a mock you can reproduce that garbled output even after the backend bug is fixed.

Testing at the right level helps eliminate sources of random failure in your test suite and thus reduces the tests that fail randomly.

#### Testing code that is poorly structured

Poorly structured code makes it difficult to test encapsulated behaviors. This is similar to the section above, in fact it's one of the biggest sources of people feeling the need to use a higher level test than actually necessary. If your code has functions that are encapsulated well, writing unit tests that have a bunch of inputs and a bunch of known outputs is easy. But if you have functions that fit together in ways that make their interaction complex, you are much more likely to start writing an integration or end to end test. And those will start to include more layers, and more layers mean more places to fail.

To use a hypothetical example: say you are writing an API client package. You have a user-facing function that requires data from a few different endpoints depending on the output from one of the two. Let's say this function looks for users who have done at least one of two different actions. The API is such that you can get a list of users and a list of the actions they have taken, but actions of one type require using one endpoint and another set of actions uses a separate endpoint. One way you could write this function is all together where it queries the first endpoint for the list of users, and then based on the information that is received, you query one (or both) of the two other endpoints, and finally produce the result. This works, but because there is a back and forth between multiple endpoints, you are much more likely to write an integration test with the entire API call cycle. But if you broke this function down into the constituent parts (fetching the users, fetching one set of actions, fetching a second set) it's much easier to mock of the data in and out (and test various combinations of users with all of one action, users with both actions, users with neither action, users with ðŸ¦Ž actions) without reaching for the integration test.

#### Randomness

Working on data and data science tools means working with data that involves randomness. When confronted with randomness, many people start by trying to embrace the randomness: "ok, let's make a random data generator for our tests..." which feels like the right answerâ€”the real-life data is random afterall! But that reaction leads directly to tests that sometimes work, and sometimes don't. There are very few situations where you actually need to have true randomness. Even with projects that use statistical reasoning, it's almost always better to construct data that fits a specific distribution than it is to generate that data during testing.

Even when working on [a benchmarking framework](http://github.com/conbench/conbench/) where statistical patterns and analyzing distributions of data was a key feature, I found it better to pregenerate fixed test data that conformed to the appropriate distributions than to generate randomness in the test framework. 

But in cases where randomness is absolutely needed, care should be taken to characterize your tests with respect to that randomness. For example, generating random data to test compression, compare the success of compression against the original size of the data[^6] as opposed to a fixed constant.

You probably don't need randomness in your tests, but in the unlikely scenario that you actually do, be sure you characterize it well in your tests and confirm that it is functioning like you expect.

#### Configuration

This is one of the most straightforward to identify and also something that can take a lot of work and knowledge to get right. All test environments need to be bootstrapped and setup things like the test running framework, installing dependencies, etc. If something goes wrong in this process the whole run looks like it failed. This is typically easy to identify in your test logs.[^2] Some of these are inevitable. If the dependency repository you're using to install goes down, there's not much you can do about that. But each time you see something like this you can ask yourself: how common is this? If it's happening frequently enough that you notice a pattern, maybe you should consider using a different mirror or change the approach you have for dependency resolution. 

One example that I ran into recently working on the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) extended CI. I noticed that some of our tests were failing due to dependency version mismatches in Debian's unstable versus testing repositories.[^7] We were using an image that happened to install a number of the core dependencies using unstable, but then our CI setup installed other dependencies with default arguments which in this case selected testing. There was a version mismatch between two dependencies we needed to install, so the jobs failed. This particular mismatch likely would only last a few days or weeks as versions transitioned from unstable to testing â€” but it also showed that our original assumptions about the image we were using wasn't what we thought it was. We had assumed it was a more-or-less generic stable image, but looking at the documentation + a chat with one of the maintainers clarified it's actually much more of a bleeding-edge kind of image. For these particular tests, we didn't want or need the bleeding-edge[^3] for this, so swapping to an image that didn't have version mismatches like this meant these jobs were much more likely to only fail when we've broken something, not when there is a slight change in unstable versus testing dependency repositories.


### So what should I do when someone says the test is flaky?

Use it as an opportunity to ask: Are these tests structured correctly? Are they testing the right layer? Are they testing code that is well encapsulated? Are they testing properties that are interesting, but not critical to the test? Is my testing setup and configuration problematic? The answer to some of these might be negative, and this is an opportunity to fix that. 

As with all things, balance is important. You could spend a lot of time and effort to overcome a once a year or so issue. But if a test is failing often enough to gain the reputation of flaky, it's worth asking: is there something I could do to improve this?

[^1]: Ok, this is actually a lie. I never heard this at places that eschewed testing entirely. Whichâ€”fair enoughâ€”I guess one way to never have failing tests is to never test anything. But that's a whole separate blog post.

[^2]: And if it's not â€” that is something you should absolutely change or reconsider your design!

[^3]: We *do* want and need to test against bleeding edge images, but those are separate tests that targets that more specifically. Those tests also use dependency resolution methods that are more amenable to changes like this. 

[^4]: But if you're curious, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation#Testing_at_different_levels) has some details.

[^5]: I'm such a fan of mocking, I even wrote [dittodb](https://dittodb.jonkeane.com), a whole framework for mocking database interactions.

[^6]: And not even this alone is actually sufficient â€” you also need to be careful that the randomness here is constrained. For example, in [our metadata compression test in Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/605f8a792c388afb2230b1f19e0f3e4df90d5abe/r/tests/testthat/test-metadata.R#L112-L151) we construct random strings and then repeat them since compression is less effective on data that has more randomness. In this test, we construct a list of two long random strings as opposed to lists of 100 smaller strings to trigger a condition where compression+serialization isn't as efficient as serialization alone.
