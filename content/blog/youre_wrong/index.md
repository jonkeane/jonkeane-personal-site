Nobody is infallible: we 

Building and sustaining a team of engineers[^1] takes a delicate balance of fostering a space for creativity, problem solving, and ownership of the products we deliver, with providing a direction and ability to change directions as needed to meet changing requirements, business needs, or world changes.   

## Every one is always wrong

## What you do when you realize you are wrong changes dynamics

### Don't double down

### Openly, confidently admit you are wrong

### The power of "sorry" 

## This isn't just for leaders(!)



[^1]: This post is written focused on software engineering teams because that is what I have the most experience with. Many (if not all!)
 of this is still broadly applicable to other teams (data scientists, analysts, etc).
