I am a data scientist striving to use technology to improve people's experiences, work, and more with a commitment and focus on reproducibility and scalability. My training has strengths in software development, predictive models, social science, as well as quantitative and statistical reasoning, giving me a unique ability to synthesize and manage quantitative data for reliable insights. I also have experience in both product management and engineering leadership leading teams to develop the right things to solve the right problems.

In my spare time I wander the world with a camera or two. I'm always looking for new experiences, cultures, and scenes to explore and learn from.
