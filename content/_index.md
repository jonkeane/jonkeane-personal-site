I am a leader building engineering and data science teams that develop technology to improve people's experiences, work, and more. I lead teams to develop the right things to solve the right problems with a commitment and focus on accuracy, actionability, and scalability. I am passionate and committed to the development of open source software as well as to developing teams that build open source software. My training has strengths in software engineering, product-driven design, data science, predictive models, social science, as well as quantitative and statistical reasoning. I also have experience in product management both in dedicated product roles as well as serving as de-facto product leader on engineering teams.

In my spare time I wander the world with a camera or two. I'm always looking for new experiences, cultures, and scenes to explore and learn from. I'm also an inveterate tinkerer and builder.
